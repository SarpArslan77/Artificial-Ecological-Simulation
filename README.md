# Artificial-Ecological-Simulation
A Pygame-based grid simulation of ecosystem dynamics. Agents interact via predation, reproduction, and resource competition. Real-time visuals and graphs track populations, birth/death rates, and predator-prey cycles. Customizable parameters for disease, resources, and more. Perfect for exploring ecological systems and emergent behaviors.
